# Causal AI Analysis Application

A Streamlit-based application for causal discovery and causal inference analysis.

## TODOs

### Development Workflow
- [ ] Create develop branch, so we don't need to change the hosted one. Create branching strategy.
- [ ] Fix errors in the regression tests if there are still any + add automatic email sending

### Research Tasks
- [ ] Check how DoWhy uses confounder variables and the graph, how we pass them
- [ ] Use 2 different causal discovery algorithms and find a way to merge them together
