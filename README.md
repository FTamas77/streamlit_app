### 🧠 What is Causal Discovery?

Causal discovery identifies **cause-and-effect relationships** from data, going beyond correlation to understand:

```
📈 Correlation: Sales ↔ Marketing Spend (related, but which causes which?)
🎯 Causation: Marketing Spend → Sales (clear direction of influence)
```

**Business Impact:**
- 💰 **ROI Optimization**: Focus budget on true drivers
- 🎯 **Strategic Planning**: Understand intervention effects  
- ⚡ **Risk Management**: Predict unintended consequences
- 🚀 **Competitive Edge**: Data-driven decision making

## 📊 Complete Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Data Upload & Preview
```python
# Supported formats: .xlsx, .csv
# Automatic data validation and statistics
```
![Data Upload Interface](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300/4CAF50/white?text=📁+Data+Upload+%26+Preview)

### Step 2: AI Domain Constraints
```python
# Example business context:
"This is marketing data where customer demographics 
come before purchase decisions, and ad spend affects 
sales but not customer age..."

# AI generates:
{
  "forbidden_edges": [["Sales", "Customer_Age"]],
  "required_edges": [["Ad_Spend", "Sales"]],
  "temporal_order": ["Customer_Age", "Ad_Spend", "Sales"]
}
```

### Step 3: Interactive Causal Graph
```python
# DirectLiNGAM discovers relationships
# Plotly creates interactive visualizations
```
![Causal Graph](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400/FF9800/white?text=🔍+Interactive+Causal+Graph)

### Step 4: Treatment Effect Analysis
```python
# DoWhy calculates Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
# Statistical validation with confidence intervals
```
![ATE Results](https://via.placeholder.com/800x300/9C27B0/white?text=📊+Treatment+Effect+Analysis)

### Step 5: Business Insights
```python
# GPT-4 powered explanations:
"A $1000 increase in marketing spend increases sales by $2,847 
on average (95% CI: $2,234 - $3,460). This relationship is 
statistically significant (p < 0.001), suggesting marketing 
is an effective investment..."
